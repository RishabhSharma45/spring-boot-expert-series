# Chapter 1 — Why Java❓

## 1. The IT Landscape of the 1990s

During the early 90s, software development heavily relied on C and C++.
While powerful, these languages brought several challenges:

- No portability — code needed OS-specific changes
- No "write once, run anywhere"
- Limited standard libraries
- Manual memory management
- Pointer-based direct memory access
- High chances of memory corruption

> Developers struggled to build scalable, secure, and portable applications.

## 2. What Sun Microsystems Observed

Sun realized the industry needed a language that was:

- Platform independent
- Secure and robust
- Object-oriented
- Easy to learn
- Supported by automatic memory management

> This gave birth to Project Green, aimed at solving real-world industrial challenges.

## 3. The Birth of Java

### Started in 1991 as Oak

### Renamed to Java in 1995

### Designed by James Gosling and his team

> Released with key goals: simplicity, portability, security, and reliability

## 4. Why Java Became Popular

Java quickly gained worldwide adoption because it offered:

- Automatic memory management (Garbage Collector)
- Built-in multithreading
- Huge standard library
- Networking APIs
- Platform independence
- Strong security model
- No pointers → Zero manual memory manipulation

### What’s Next?

Before you ask “How exactly Java achieved all of this?”
— platform independence,
— security,
— automatic memory management…
